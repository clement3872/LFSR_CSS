# LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) Module

## Overview
This module implements a basic Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), which is a shift register that takes the exclusive OR (XOR) of a subset of its bits, shifts the bits, and inserts the XOR result back into the register. LFSRs are useful in cryptography, digital signal processing, and other areas where pseudo-randomly generated sequences are required.

## Features
- Initialize an LFSR with a specified size, status, and list of XOR tap positions.
- Generate the next bit in the sequence with simple method calls.
- Allows continuation from a specified status using `last_output`.

## Requirements
This module requires Python 3.x.

## Usage
To use the LFSR class in your Python scripts, follow these steps:

1. Import the LFSR class from this module.
2. Create an instance of LFSR by specifying the size, initial status, and the positions that should be XORed.
3. Call the `next()` method to generate the next bit in the sequence.

### Example
```python
from default import LFSR  # Assuming the file is named default.py

# Create an LFSR instance with specific parameters
lfsr = LFSR(size=16, status=0b1100101, xor_list=[1, 5, 6])

# Generate the next bit
print(lfsr.next())
```
